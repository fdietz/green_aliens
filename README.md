## Credits
Most of the code is a derivate work based on [Pascal Rettig's](https://github.com/cykod) book [Professional HTML5 Mobile Game Development](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Professional-HTML5-Mobile-Game-Development.productCd-1118301323.html). I can highly recommend it to everyone looking into HTML5 game development. The explosion assets are also taken from the book's samples.
